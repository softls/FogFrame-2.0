 * Service that handles the reasoning of the whole fog landscape. This includes the task request handling, resource
 * provisioning, topology monitoring and event creating, amongst others. Most of the decisions and plans made in the
 * total environment are made in this service, e.g., service placement in the cloud or fog are started, etc.
